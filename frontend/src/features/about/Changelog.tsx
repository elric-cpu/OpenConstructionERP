  { version: '8.11.0', date: '2026-06-25', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'A change intelligence and value release: the AI trust envelope and an accuracy scoreboard are now visible wherever the assistant speaks, a Value Realized dashboard proves the payoff of acting early on your own ledger, and change accountability deepens with an ownership hand-off log, a provability score, dispute and delay risk, scope-ambiguity grading, multi-party back-charge recovery and exportable evidence packs. It also adds a Phone Log for verbal instructions, Document Connectors that pull a watched folder onto the record, and Find Records - one faceted search across documents, correspondence and change orders with provenance on every hit.' },
  { version: '8.10.0', date: '2026-06-24', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'A new Change Intelligence page brings the change-adjacent modules into one project view with six co-pilots: what to act on first, who owes the next action and by when, the committed cost and schedule of approved changes, a back-charge recovery ledger, and a clarifier that turns a rough note into a structured request. It builds on a new change-intelligence layer - a unified timeline, approval breach monitoring and delegation, ball-in-court tracking across the change family, change cycle-time and impact analytics, an AI accuracy scoreboard, a claims evidence pack and inbound email delay detection.' },
  { version: '8.9.1', date: '2026-06-23', tag: 'FIX', summary: 'A correctness and hardening release. The 4D earned-value dashboard now serves every money value as an exact decimal string (no binary-float drift; SPI, CPI and percentages stay numbers), and creating a cross-project schedule link now rejects an activity that does not belong to its schedule with a clear error instead of dropping the link silently during portfolio analysis.' },
  { version: '8.9.0', date: '2026-06-23', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'A major construction quality and project-controls release: a new Construction Control (QA/QC) module spanning acceptance criteria and inspections, material and lab records with EN 10204 and ISO/IEC 17025, as-built records with metrology tolerance and e-signed validity, hold and witness points, and a regime-aware handover acceptance package. It also completes the advanced scheduling suite with lossless interchange, a claims-grade critical-path engine, schedule comparison, Monte-Carlo risk, forensic delay analysis, resource histograms and leveling, a live collaboration view, a multi-project portfolio with cross-project critical path, grouping by user-defined field, calendar-aware date math and persisted earned-value snapshots.' },
  { version: '8.8.4', date: '2026-06-22', tag: 'SECURITY', summary: 'A security and data-integrity hardening release from a deep internal audit. It closes cross-tenant access gaps across procurement, private cost catalogues, property development, BIM requirement validation and quantity-mapping rules, safety records, business-intelligence dashboards, clash triage and document revisions, adds role checks to the estimate-at-completion engine, and sanitises custom document-template previews against stored cross-site scripting. It also fixes fixed-amount markup totals that added up as text, a lost-update race on posted actual cost, phantom budget commitments left by cancelled purchase orders, metadata-overwriting edits in the Geo Hub and safety modules, a Monte Carlo chart that labelled every bar NaN, the broken compliance CSV export, and dashboards that showed healthy green zeros when their data failed to load.' },
  { version: '8.8.3', date: '2026-06-21', tag: 'SECURITY', summary: 'A security and quality release: rebuilding the bill-of-quantities search index now enforces per-project ownership, so no account can rebuild or purge another tenant index by id, and the resource summary converts foreign-currency resources into the project base currency before totalling. It also stops partial edits to bills, markups and takeoff measurements from dropping saved details, fixes the safety incident-rate metric that always read zero, and lets the federated 3D viewer degrade gracefully where WebGL2 is unavailable.' },
  { version: '8.8.2', date: '2026-06-21', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'BIM and CAD converters now install themselves the first time you upload a model, with no Settings trip and no manual steps: the install tries a system package install, a rootless unpack, and a built-in pure-Python reader in turn, so it works on minimal containers and non-Debian hosts too, resuming slow downloads and self-testing the binary afterwards. Bill-of-quantities exports and the compare view also convert foreign-currency amounts into the project base currency before totalling, at both the position and resource level, so mixed-currency exports add up correctly.' },
  { version: '8.8.1', date: '2026-06-21', tag: 'FIX', summary: 'A quick follow-up fix: a PDF uploaded for quantity takeoff now stays attached to the active project, so it remains in the document list after you reload the page. Previously the upload was saved without a project and the project-filtered list dropped it on refresh.' },
  { version: '8.8.0', date: '2026-06-21', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'Monte-Carlo cost-risk analysis turns a bill of quantities into a full cost distribution - P5 to P95 bands, a probability S-curve, a recommended contingency at your confidence level, and a tornado chart of the biggest variance drivers - and a new in-app "How it works" hub explains every module in all 27 languages. This release also adds lightweight 2D project maps in the Geo Hub, a DIN 276 element breakdown in cost benchmarks, count-by-example symbol counting in takeoff, quantity-weighted progress rollups, and a background converter install that no longer times out on slow servers.' },
  { version: '8.7.1', date: '2026-06-20', tag: 'FIX', summary: 'A maintenance release: the repeated "request timed out" message no longer floods the screen on a busy server, a CAD drawing whose conversion was interrupted by a restart now shows a clear, recoverable error instead of spinning forever, and the AI Estimator no longer analyses the source twice when you start a new estimate. It also confines the AI agent reading tools to projects the user can access, aligns the transmittals statuses with the backend, and polishes the guided AI estimate, point cloud and Geo Hub screens.' },
  { version: '8.7.0', date: '2026-06-20', tag: 'SECURITY', summary: 'A broad security release: cross-tenant access gaps were closed across requirements, contacts, project controls and other modules, monetary inputs now reject not-a-number, infinity and absurd magnitudes, currency roll-ups no longer blend different currencies, and partial edits no longer drop the fields they did not mention. It also adds methodology-aware country and industry packs, PDF and Excel export for methodology estimates, LAS, LAZ and COPC point cloud reading, and a clear no-geometry notice for BIM models that have no 3D mesh.' },
  { version: '8.6.1', date: '2026-06-19', tag: 'FIX', summary: '3D BIM models, DWG drawings and takeoff PDFs that had been uploaded and marked ready could fail to open with a file-not-found error on standalone-PostgreSQL, Docker and macOS deployments, because the files were written to one location and read from another. Storage now resolves a single consistent data directory across every launch mode, with a fallback that still finds files saved by earlier versions, so existing uploads keep working.' },
  { version: '8.6.0', date: '2026-06-18', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'A data-driven estimating methodology engine: instead of one fixed markup chain, a project can follow a named methodology you build in the app, with a typed bill-of-quantities hierarchy, analytical dimensions, funding sources and a cascade of markups that build on one another. Country and industry templates ship ready to install, the cascade editor shows a live preview reconciled against the server, and construction machinery is now costed separately from installed equipment.' },
  { version: '8.5.0', date: '2026-06-18', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'DWG and DXF takeoff is now a full vector takeoff: one click produces a per-layer quantity table with the right unit for each layer, plus a count-by-block tool, drawing-text search and one-click Excel export. The PDF takeoff viewer gains a page-thumbnail sidebar, find-on-sheet, scale detection and fit and zoom controls, steel can be priced by mass, and the 3D viewer now degrades gracefully on marginal GPUs.' },
  { version: '8.4.0', date: '2026-06-17', tag: 'FIX', summary: 'PDF takeoff measurements are now scoped to the project and the specific document they were drawn on rather than keyed by file name, so two files that share a name no longer show the same measurements. The resources under a bill-of-quantities position now expand on the first click, and the public hosted demo keeps its bundled cost databases read-only.' },
  { version: '8.3.3', date: '2026-06-15', tag: 'FIX', summary: 'Totals that summed money values arriving from the server as text were concatenating instead of adding, producing wrong figures. This is fixed across the Excel and PDF bill-of-quantities exports, the assembly rate rollups, the BOQ tree and resource subtotals, the cost model planned, committed, actual, forecast and variance columns, the bid analysis breakdown, and the chat and AI estimate totals.' },
  { version: '8.3.2', date: '2026-06-15', tag: 'SECURITY', summary: 'Money figures that the server sends as text no longer break the screens that show them, so tender and bill-of-quantities exports, the reports and analytics totals, the cost benchmark, the 5D cost model, the regional rate adjustment and the cost-match panels all render their amounts reliably. Access checks were also tightened so an account only opens and changes records in projects it can reach, covering bill-of-quantities locking, the safety toolbox-talk and corrective-action endpoints, timecard import and shared saved views.' },
  { version: '8.3.1', date: '2026-06-15', tag: 'FIX', summary: 'Sample projects are now clearly labelled and easy to remove so a fresh install can start from an empty workspace, a new project takes its currency from your regional preference, and the AI estimate builder, the match-to-cost wizard and the assembly template dialog now follow the project chosen in the top bar. Regional cost-database downloads explain a blocked connection and offer a retry, and the new wording is translated across all 26 other languages.' },
  { version: '8.3.0', date: '2026-06-15', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'A new South Africa construction pack, the first in our African coverage, pre-configured with SANS 1200 and ASAQS measurement, CIDB contractor grading, the PPPFA 80/20 and 90/10 procurement scoring, the nine provinces and the rand with 15 percent VAT, and Johannesburg cost data on demand. This release also translates the most recent feature screens across all 26 other languages.' },
  { version: '8.2.2', date: '2026-06-15', tag: 'FIX', summary: 'The macOS desktop app no longer opens with a "damaged" warning. The build is now ad-hoc signed across the app and its bundled local server so the code signature is valid, and the install guide explains the one-time command to clear the download quarantine.' },
  { version: '8.2.1', date: '2026-06-15', tag: 'SECURITY', summary: 'A hardening release. Editing one part of a record no longer clears the other details saved on it, fixed across more than two dozen modules where a partial edit used to overwrite the whole stored details field. Paying an invoice now updates budget actuals correctly when some of the spend was already received, cost breakdowns convert mixed currencies before totalling, and reversing a ledger entry writes back every leg. Access checks were tightened so an account only reads and changes records in projects it can reach, and high-value variations, awarded bids and permit activation now require the matching permission.' },
  { version: '8.2.0', date: '2026-06-14', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'A new project journey map in the top bar names the phase you are in and opens the whole project lifecycle, from winning the work to handover, with every major module placed on its phase as a link, translated in every language. This release also warns when a project exchange rate looks entered upside down, validates BIM models imported from spreadsheets or bulk files, and flags scanned PDF pages in takeoff that need OCR.' },
  { version: '8.1.0', date: '2026-06-14', tag: 'SECURITY', summary: 'A broad access-control pass makes sure every account only sees and changes data in the projects it can reach, across finance, business intelligence, jobs, approval workflows, the cost catalogue, lead webhooks, property development and the chat assistant; a request that omits a project filter is now scoped to your own projects. A new top-bar news button opens the latest release news, the takeoff CSV export subtracts openings the way Excel does, and DIN 276 cost groups validate across the full code hierarchy.' },
  { version: '8.0.0', date: '2026-06-13', tag: 'MILESTONE', summary: 'Every major module now has a built-in guide: a help button opens a short panel that explains what the module does, the main steps and a few tips, in your language. This release also fixes DWG takeoff drawings on a fresh install, clears links to deleted bill of quantities positions, hardens cross-tenant access on the BOQ and AI estimator endpoints, and finishes the interface translation in every language.' },
  { version: '7.10.0', date: '2026-06-13', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'ERP Chat now renders Markdown tables as real tables, and the quick create and project setup windows are fully translated in all 27 languages. Regional cost catalogues download on demand instead of shipping inside the install, so it is about 15 MB lighter while all thirty regions stay available.' },
  { version: '7.9.0', date: '2026-06-13', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'You can now keep your own company price books in the cost database, import them from Excel or CSV, filter by catalogue and export back to Excel, with thirty regional catalogues working offline. The 5D cost model gains an earned value column, estimate-based schedules get realistic durations, and an audit pass fixes European decimal rates, budget duplication, blended foreign-currency change orders and the project switcher.' },
  { version: '7.8.0', date: '2026-06-12', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'The bill of quantities gains optional Material, Labor and Equipment columns that show how each unit rate splits across the three, plus three worked retail example projects for German cities. Consolidated ledger statements are now admin-only, imported rules stay per project, the BOQ Excel export reconciles again, and fixes land for AI estimate numbers, empty validation passes, the 3D viewer and translated messages.' },
  { version: '7.7.0', date: '2026-06-11', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'BOQ descriptions can now hold a full multi-line specification like a German LV Langtext, row height cycles between three sizes, and the New BOQ window imports GAEB, BC3, Excel, CSV, PDF or CAD on the spot. Partner, country and industry packs sit under one Packs tab, a worked discount-store example project ships, GAEB X84 import no longer loses money and exports valid 3.3, and large point-cloud uploads finish reliably.' },
  { version: '7.6.0', date: '2026-06-11', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'A new finance general ledger keeps a chart of accounts and produces a trial balance, income statement, balance sheet and cash flow, you can erase your own account from Settings, and takeoff can read a PDF plan with a vision model. Large uploads resume after a dropped connection, limits are much higher, a saved-views module remembers filtered lists, and tenant isolation and money math were hardened across twelve modules.' },
  { version: '7.5.0', date: '2026-06-10', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'Takeoff Recognize now reads scanned drawings with no vector layer, you can drag a placed measurement directly on the drawing with the quantity updating live, and a Save PDF button exports the marked-up drawing. Cost Benchmarks compare a project against your own portfolio by currency, file downloads are fixed for every file including DWG and IFC, and the dashboard quick-upload gains a project picker.' },
  { version: '7.4.0', date: '2026-06-10', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'Takeoff measurements and markups now open the real drawing with the item in view, example projects start with real site photos, and a new Point Cloud beta registers laser scan, photogrammetry and LIDAR clouds. Many modules now arrive filled with example data, and the AI Estimate Builder no longer crashes when you confirm the parameter sheet.' },
  { version: '7.3.0', date: '2026-06-08', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'BIM viewer grouping and filtering on IFC models line up with the geometry again and stay on the selection, the upload picker accepts RVT, IFC and DWG only, and a new schedule-quality pack adds seven checks. Self-explaining modules arrive across the platform with confidence badges, suggestion chips, plain-language errors and an inline glossary in every language.' },
  { version: '7.2.0', date: '2026-06-08', tag: 'FIX',       summary: 'Fixes the Windows app that could get stuck on "Recovering the local database" under the Turkish regional format, and heals a machine already stuck. The AI Estimate Builder no longer shows a fake $0.00, reads parameters in plain words and shows live progress, the BIM filter panel is translated in all 26 languages, and module switching, the RVT converter and IFC filters work correctly again.' },
  { version: '7.1.0', date: '2026-06-07', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'Related records are now one click away everywhere, with over 80 new two-way links across variations, change orders, contracts, clashes and inspections, and the AI Estimate Builder talks you through scope with editable work packages and explained rates. The desktop app sets itself up on first launch, and about a thousand interface strings per language were brought to native copy in all 26 languages.' },
  { version: '7.0.1', date: '2026-06-06', tag: 'FIX',       summary: 'Fixes the Windows desktop app that could close on its own right after opening. It now shows a clear error if it cannot start, reuses a running backend only when versions match, and installs without needing a download.' },
  { version: '7.0.0', date: '2026-06-06', tag: 'MILESTONE', summary: 'A new AI Estimate Builder turns a typed scope, a BIM model or uploaded files into a priced bill of quantities, with prices always from the cost catalogue, and every module now has one clean title and a short explainer card in all 27 languages. The collaboration hub is a real workspace, and many modules got fixes so dashboards, validation and matching just work.' },
  { version: '6.10.0', date: '2026-06-05', tag: 'NEW',      summary: 'Field time tracking with real payroll, where a crew lead logs hours that flow into a payroll batch and post to the ledger exactly once, plus a project-controls dashboard for cost, schedule, quality, safety and risk health. Owner billing forms for US, Canada and Australia, a subcontractor payment portal, and a client progress-reports tab round out the release.' },
  { version: '6.9.0', date: '2026-06-05', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'A new Management of Change register screen, with cost matching working again for projects outside the US and backup restore limited to your own data so it cannot wipe another user. Plus broad backend hardening and the desktop fixes from the 6.8 builds.' },
  { version: '6.8.2', date: '2026-06-05', tag: 'FIX',       summary: 'The Windows, macOS and Linux desktop installers build again, carrying the 6.8.1 database fix that had shipped on pip and Docker but not as an installer.' },
  { version: '6.8.1', date: '2026-06-05', tag: 'FIX',       summary: 'The desktop app now launches reliably after install. It connects to its own local database correctly and shows a clear message plus a startup log if anything goes wrong, instead of failing silently.' },
  { version: '6.8.0', date: '2026-06-04', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'Quantity takeoff on DWG drawings now reports correct real-world metres, and a wave of features links the modules together, from subcontractor scorecards and progress claims to resource leveling and offline field work. Interface translation gaps were cleared across all 26 non-English languages.' },
