"""PostgreSQL auto-migrator (embedded and external PostgreSQL).

On startup, compares the live PostgreSQL schema against the SQLAlchemy models
and adds any missing columns via ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS``
plus any missing model-declared plain-column indexes via
``CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`` (upgraded installs are alembic-STAMPED, not
alembic-run, so an index added in a later release - e.g.
``ix_oe_costs_item_catalog_id`` - would otherwise never materialise and the
largest table would seq-scan forever).

This is the PostgreSQL counterpart to :func:`app.core.sqlite_migrator.sqlite_auto_migrate`.
The embedded-PostgreSQL default runtime (v6.0.0+, no Docker) builds its schema
with ``Base.metadata.create_all``, which only ever creates *missing tables* and
never alters an existing one. So when the app is upgraded across versions, any
column added to an existing table (for example ``oe_boq_position.cost_line_id``
from the v6.4.0 cost spine) is absent from a database created under the older
version, and every ORM read of that table fails with ``UndefinedColumnError``.

This runs for the embedded server AND for external PostgreSQL. External
deployments are still expected to manage their schema with Alembic
(``alembic upgrade head``), but in practice many run the image without that
step, so an upgrade that added a column leaves the live table missing it and
every ORM read 500s. Because every statement here is ``ADD COLUMN`` /
``CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`` - idempotent and non-destructive - it is safe
to run as a belt-and-braces heal regardless of who owns the schema. The call
site wraps it non-fatally so a DB role without DDL rights simply skips it.

Concurrency- and traffic-safe on shared external databases: the heal takes a
transaction-scoped advisory lock (only one worker heals at a time), bounds each
DDL with ``SET LOCAL lock_timeout`` so it never blocks live queries behind an
open transaction, and wraps every statement in its own SAVEPOINT so a single
failure cannot poison the rest of the heal.
