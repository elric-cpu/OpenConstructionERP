"""Contracts validation rules.

Ships three first-class rules registered with the platform rule registry under
the ``contracts`` rule set:

* ``ContractPartyRolesRule`` (ERROR) - a signed contract (active / completed)
  must carry at least one employer party and one contractor party.
* ``ContractPerformanceBondRule`` (WARNING) - a contract whose terms require a
  performance bond should have an active security row of that type.
* ``EOTDaysRule`` (ERROR) - a decided extension-of-time claim must never grant
  more days than were claimed.

The rules run against a plain dict context (no ORM), shaped by the service /
caller as::

    {
        "contract": {"id", "status", "contract_type", "terms": {...}},
        "parties": [{"party_role", "party_type", ...}],
        "securities": [{"security_type", "status", ...}],
        "eot_claims": [{"eot_number", "days_claimed", "days_granted", "status"}],
    }

Keeping the rules pure and dict-driven makes them trivially unit-testable and
satisfies the platform "no module without validation rules" requirement.
