"""Pure derivation engine for the basis-of-estimate.

Turns the finished estimate contents (a flat list of BOQ position dicts) into a
structured, editable basis-of-estimate: the inclusions, exclusions and
assumptions that qualify what an estimate does and does not cover.

The engine is deliberately stdlib-only - no ORM, no app imports - so it loads on
a bare interpreter and can be unit tested without a database or the FastAPI
dependency graph. The service layer feeds it plain dicts and persists whatever
it returns.

Two derivations happen here:

* :func:`derive_trades` reads which work sections (trades) are present, absent or
  flagged in the estimate. A trade is keyed on the DIN 276 main cost group
  (an open classification standard already used across the platform); a position
  with no classification is matched on its description keywords as a fallback so
  a BOQ imported without cost codes still yields useful coverage.
* :func:`draft_basis` turns that coverage into the three qualification lists. A
  present trade becomes an inclusion, an expected-but-absent trade becomes an
  exclusion, and each quality flag (unpriced lines, missing quantities,
  provisional sums, work marked "by others") becomes an assumption. A fixed set
  of standard estimate qualifications is always drafted so the document reads
  like one an estimator would hand a client.

Every drafted line carries a deterministic id so a regenerate is stable and the
UI can key, reorder and toggle items without server round-trips.

# ── Trade taxonomy (DIN 276 main cost groups) ───────────────────────────────
#
# The main groups of DIN 276:2018-12, used here as an open, language-neutral
# work-section taxonomy. ``core`` marks the groups a normal building estimate is
# expected to carry (building construction + technical systems, matching the
# platform's DIN276 completeness rule); their absence is a meaningful exclusion
# rather than simply "not applicable". ``keywords`` drive the description
# fallback for positions that arrive without a cost code - kept conservative so
# a stray word does not misfile a line.
