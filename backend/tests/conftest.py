"""Shared test fixtures.

Test isolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Per ``feedback_test_isolation.md``: backend tests must NEVER touch the
production database. Several integration suites
(``test_api_smoke``, ``test_boq_regression``, ``test_boq_import_safety``,
``test_boq_cycle_detection``, ``test_boq_cost_item_link``) construct the
FastAPI app via ``create_app()`` which imports ``app.database`` and
binds ``async_session_factory`` to whatever ``DATABASE_URL`` is set at
that moment — so the env vars have to point at a throwaway PostgreSQL
cluster *before* any ``from app...`` import runs.

Doing it here in ``tests/conftest.py`` (which pytest loads before any
test module) guarantees the override beats every test-module import
order, regardless of which suite is collected first. Tests that already
self-redirect (``test_tenant_isolation``, ``test_register_bootstrap``,
etc.) are still fine — they overwrite this with their own connection.

# ── Windows asyncpg event-loop policy ──────────────────────────────────────
# On Windows the default ProactorEventLoop leaves asyncpg socket transports to
# be finalized by the GC after the per-test loop has closed, surfacing as a
# noisy "RuntimeError: Event loop is closed" at teardown. The SelectorEventLoop
# policy (the default on Linux/macOS) closes them deterministically. Must run
# before any event loop is created.

# ── Per-session PostgreSQL isolation (must run before app imports) ──────────
# The app is PostgreSQL-only at runtime, so the test suite runs on PostgreSQL
# too. Two ways to provide it:
#   * CI sets ``DATABASE_URL`` (a postgres service container) — honour it as-is.
#   * Otherwise boot a throwaway embedded PostgreSQL 16 cluster (no Docker) into
#     a temp data dir for the session. ``embedded_pg.boot`` points
#     ``DATABASE_URL`` / ``DATABASE_SYNC_URL`` at the embedded cluster and is
#     registered for shutdown via ``atexit`` so the postmaster is stopped when
#     the run ends (the temp dir is reclaimed by the OS regardless).
# This must happen before any ``from app...`` import that pulls in
# ``app.database`` (which builds the engine from ``settings.database_url`` at
# import time).

# ── Rate-limiter relaxation for tests ──────────────────────────────────────
# The integration suites repeatedly hit ``/auth/register`` and ``/auth/login``
# from the same in-process ``test`` client. The default 10/min login limit
# (and 100/min API limit) is fine for production but makes whole-suite
# runs flake with 429s long before the relevant assertion fires. Tests
# don't measure rate-limiter behaviour itself (those tests stand up their
# own ``RateLimiter(...)`` instance), so we lift the bucket here.

# ── Open registration for the suite ────────────────────────────────────────
# The default registration mode is "admin-approve" (every registrant after the
# first bootstrap admin is created inactive and cannot log in). The integration
# suites register a fresh user per module and immediately log in, so under the
# default they get a 401 and the auth fixture errors out. Open mode keeps every
# registrant active. The two mode-specific suites (test_register_modes,
# test_register_bootstrap) set the mode themselves and are unaffected.
os.environ.setdefault("REGISTRATION_MODE", "open")

# ── Skip demo account seeding for tests ───────────────────────────────────
# The startup lifespan creates demo@openconstructionerp.com (and two sibling
# accounts) every time create_app() boots. Although has_admin() is designed
# to exclude those demo emails from the bootstrap check, the seeding still
# costs time and writes rows that can interact with per-module auth fixtures.
# test_demo_login_endpoint.py sets SEED_DEMO=true inside its own fixture and
# is unaffected. All other suites work without the demo accounts.

# ── Fast app startup for tests ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Each integration module stands up its own FastAPI app via create_app() and
# runs the full lifespan. In production that lifespan connects to the vector
# backend, loads the embedding model (~35s) and installs the flagship showcase
# project (6640 elements + ~16MB of geometry). None of that is needed by the
# test suite, and paid per module it is the dominant cost of the whole run.
# This flag skips the vector init/warm-up and the flagship seed; vector
# endpoints still work because the embedder loads lazily on first use.
os.environ.setdefault("OE_TEST_FAST_STARTUP", "1")

# ── NullPool for the shared app engine under tests ─────────────────────────
# pytest-asyncio runs each test in its own event loop. asyncpg connections are
# loop-bound, so a connection pooled on one test's loop and reused on the next
# raises "Task ... attached to a different loop". The production engine uses a
# sized QueuePool; here we tell the engine factory to use NullPool so every
# checkout opens a fresh connection on the current loop. Must be set before the
# first ``import app...`` below builds the engine. The fast per-test isolation
# helpers in ``tests/_pg.py`` already use NullPool for the same reason.

# ── Synchronous event publishing in tests ──────────────────────────────────
# Production wraps ``event_bus.publish`` in ``asyncio.create_task`` via
# :meth:`EventBus.publish_detached` so the database connection isn't
# held by the request session while subscribers open theirs. Tests, however,
# typically do ``await service.X()`` then immediately assert on a captured
# events fixture — the scheduled task hasn't yielded to the loop yet. To
# preserve pre-v2.6.47 sync semantics for tests we shim ``publish_detached``
# to use an immediate ``ensure_future`` + a ``run`` of pending callbacks
# before returning, so when control comes back to the test's next line the
# event has already fanned out to subscribers.
from app.core.events import event_bus as _event_bus  # noqa: E402

# Handlers that perform real async I/O - they open their own DB session
# (webhook dispatch), write an activity-log row (BOQ) or persist a timeline
# ActivityLog row (timeline bridge). These are the three ``"*"`` wildcard
# subscribers in the codebase, so each is present for *every* event once the
# full app has started (i.e. in integration tests). Manually stepping a
# coroutine that does real asyncpg I/O via ``coro.send(None)`` corrupts the
# connection ("await wasn't used with future") and poisons the test's session,
# so whenever one of these is registered we let the event loop drive the publish
# instead. NOTE: keep this in sync with every ``event_bus.subscribe("*", ...)``
# in app/ - a wildcard handler missing here is half-stepped and silently
# poisons whichever unit test happens to publish first (manifests as a
# ``GeneratorExit`` deep in asyncpg on the next DB op).

    Two regimes, distinguished by whether a real-I/O wildcard handler is wired:

    * **Unit tests** subscribe a pure-Python recorder to the bus, call a
      service that fires ``publish_detached`` and then immediately assert on the
      captured events. No I/O handler is registered, so we drive the publish
      coroutine to completion in-line — pure subscribers finish on the first
      ``send(None)`` — preserving that synchronous contract exactly.

    * **Integration tests** run the full app, which registers wildcard handlers
      that open their own DB session (webhook dispatch, BOQ activity log). Those
      do real asyncpg I/O; stepping them by hand corrupts the connection. When
      such a handler is registered for the event we instead schedule the publish
      as a detached task, exactly as production does, so the loop drives the I/O
      correctly.

    Either way an awaitable is returned for callers/tests that use it.
