# /release-version-bump

Use this workflow when working on **release-version-bump** in `OpenConstructionERP`.

## Goal

Prepares and documents a new release version, updating changelogs, version numbers, and release notes across backend, frontend, and desktop.

## Common Files

- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `backend/pyproject.toml`
- `frontend/package.json`
- `frontend/package-lock.json`
- `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- `frontend/src/features/about/Changelog.tsx`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
- Bump version numbers in backend/pyproject.toml, frontend/package.json, desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
- Update frontend/src/features/about/Changelog.tsx
- Optionally update ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md for credits

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.
